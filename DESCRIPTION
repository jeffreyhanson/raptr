Description: Biodiversity is in crisis. The overarching aim of conservation
    is to preserve biodiversity patterns and processes. To this end, protected
    areas are established to buffer species and preserve biodiversity processes.
    But resources are limited and so protected areas must be cost-effective.
    This package contains functions to generate plans for protected areas--
    prioritisations--using the Representatiev and Adequate Sample Problem (RASP).
    Reserve selection problems are expressed as a mixed linear integer problem
    (MILP) and solved using exact-algorithm solvers. Prioritisations can be obtained
    using Gurobi (obtained from <http://www.gurobi.com/>).
