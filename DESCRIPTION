Description: Biodiversity is in crisis. The overarching aim of conservation
    is to preserve biodiversity patterns and processes. To this end, protected
    areas are established to buffer species and preserve biodiversity processes.
    But resources are limited and so protected areas must be cost-effective. This
    package contains functions to generate plans for protected areas. Conservation
    planning data are used to construct an optimisation problem, which in turn
    is then solved to yield prioritisations. Amount-based targets can be used to
    identify prioritisations that contain an adequate amount of the target species.
    Additionally, space-based targets can be used to ensure that a representative
    sample of the target species are preserved. To solve the optimisation problems
    in a feasible amount of time, this package uses the commerical 'Gurobi' software
    package (obtained from <http://www.gurobi.com/>). Additinally, the 'rgurobi'
    package can be installed to provide extra functionality (obtained from <http://
    github.com/jeffreyhanson/rgurobi>).
