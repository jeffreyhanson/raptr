\title{RapResults: An S4 class to represent RAP results}
\description{
This class is used to store RAP results.
}
\details{
The \code{summary} table follows Marxan conventions (summary.dat in \url{http://marxan.net/downloads/uq_marxan_web_2/module5.html}). The columns
are:
\tabular{cl}{
\code{Run_Number}
\tab The index of each solution in the object. \cr
\code{Status}
\tab The status of the solution. The values in this column correspond to
 outputs from the Gurobi software package (\url{http://www.gurobi.com/documentation/6.5/refman/optimization_status_codes.html}).\cr
\code{Score}
\tab The objective function for the solution. \cr
\code{Cost}
\tab Total cost associated with a solution \cr
\code{Planning_Units}
\tab Number of planning units selected in a solution \cr
\code{Connectivity_Total}
\tab The total amount of shared boundary length between all planning units.
All solutions in the same object should have equal values for this column. \cr
\code{Connectivity_In}
\tab The amount of shared boundary length among planning units selected in
the solution \cr
\code{Connectivity_Edge}
\tab The amount of exposed boundary length in the solution \cr
\code{Connectivity_Out}
\tab The number of shared boundary length among planning units not selected
in the solution  \cr
\code{Connectivity_Fraction}
\tab The ratio of shared boundary length in the solution
(\code{Connectivity_In}) to the total amount of boundary length
(\code{Connectivity_Edge}). This ratio is an indicator of solution quality.
Solutions with a lower ratio will have less planning units and will be more
efficient. \cr
