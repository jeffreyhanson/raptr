\description{
This dataset contains data to generate example prioritizations for the
pale-headed Rosella (\emph{Platycercus adscitus}) in Queensland, Australia.
}
\details{
The objects in the dataset are listed below.
\describe{
\item{\code{"cs_pus.gpkg"}}{Geopackage file containing planning units.
The units were generated as \eqn{30km^2} squares across the
species' range, and then clipped to the Queensland, Australia
(using data obtained from the Australia Bureau of Statistics; \url{https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1259.0.30.001?OpenDocument}).
They were then overlaid with Australia's protected area
network (obtained from the World Database on Protected Areas
(WDPA) at \url{https://www.protectedplanet.net/en}). This
attribute table has 3 fields. The \code{area} field denotes
the amount of land encompassed by each unit, the \code{cost}
field is set to 1 for all units, and the \code{status} field
indicates if 50\% or more of the units' extent is covered by
protected areas.}
\item{\code{"cs_spp.tif"}}{GeoTIFF file containing probability
distribution map for the \emph{P. adscitus} clipped to
Queensland, Australia. This map was derived from records
obtained from The Atlas of Living Australia (\url{https://ala.org.au/})}.
\item{\code{"cs_space.tif"}}{GeoTIFF file describing broad-scale climate
variation across Queensland
(obtained from \url{https://worldclim.org/},
and resampled to \eqn{10km^2} resolution).}
