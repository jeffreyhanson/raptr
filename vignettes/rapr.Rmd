To fulfil this aim, reserve networks are used to safeguard biodiversity patterns (eg. species, populations) and processes (eg. evolutionary processes that underpin genetic variation). Reserve selection is often formulated as an optimisation problem to identify cost-effective prioritisations. However, most existing decision support tools are based on formulations that are well suited for preserving biodiversity patterns, but not biodiversity processes. To fill this gap in the conservation planning toolbox, we developed the \texttt{rapr R} package. This \texttt{R} package provides a toolkit to guide reserve selection using novel formulations of this problem. Here, we explore the functionality of this R package using simulated species and a conservation planning exercise in Queensland, Australia as a case-study. We demonstrate how explicitly considering biodiversity processes can alter a prioritisation. In most cases, we found that only a few additional plannning units are required to sufficiently preserve of biodiversity processes."

## Introduction
<!-- conservation and reserve networks -->
The overarching aim of conservation is to maximise the long-term persistence of biodiversity [@r423; @r255]. To achieve this, conservation actions must preserve biodiversity patterns (eg. species, populations) and the processes that sustain them. One of the major tangible achievements of modern conservation has been the act of setting aside areas for preservation [@r440]. Reserve networks buffer species from threatening processes [eg. urbanisation; @r255] and set the stage for direct management interventions [eg. captive breeding and reintroduction programs; @r290]. However, the resources available for conservation action are limited, and so reserve networks must be sited in places that satisfy conservation objectives for minimum cost [@r255]. To achieve this, reserve selection is often formulated as an optimisation problem and then solved to identify cost-effective candidate reserve systems [prioritisations; @r255].

<!-- biodiversity processes are important -->
To fulfil the overarching aims of conservation, reserve networks must preserve both ecological and evolutionary processes [@r3; @r255]. Ecological processes, such as predator-prey interactions, pollination, and decomposition, are required for biodiversity to persist over short time-scales. Typically, they operate over small geographic domains--with exceptions such as migration and refugial habitats--and can be preserved using suitably large planning units [@r446] that each contain a discrete unit of habitat [@r448]. On the other hand, evolutionary processes are required for biodiversity to persist over long time-scales, and they typically operate over large geographic domains. Protected areas must preserve adaptive evolutionary processes to foster resilience against environmental change [eg. climate change; @r247]. Protected areas must also preserve neutral evolutionary processes [@r5; @r67; @r63]. These processes are associated with the breakdown of gene flow between populations. They are important for maintaining genetic diversity, and avoiding inbreeding depression. In recent decades, a wealth of data on biodiversity processes has become available to conservation planners [eg. bioclimatic, genetic, and trait data; @r33; @r453; @481]. Yet this data is only rarely used to guide conservation planning [@r61]. This is due to that fact that existing reserve selection tools focus on preserving biodiversity patterns or processes--but not both.

<!-- how biodiversity patterns and processes are parametrised typical conservation planning tools -->
Many decision support tools have been developed to help identify cost-effective prioritisations [eg. \texttt{ ConsNet}, @r446; \texttt{ Marxan}, @r22; \texttt{ Zonation}, @r429]. Typically, these tools are used to deliver a prioritisation that preserves a set of target species (or features). Given a set of species, decision makers can use these tools to preserve biodiversity patterns by generating a prioritisation that secures an adequate proportion of each species' range. These tools, however, are not well-suited for biodiversity processes [but see @r203]. To preserve biodiversity processes, a prioritisation must preserve a representative sample of each species. For instance, to preserve predator-prey interactions, a prioritisation must preserve individuals from each predator and prey species in the same area. To preserve adaptive evolutionary processes, a prioritisation must preserve the adaptive landscape of each species--it must preserve individuals experiencing different selection pressures [@r63]. To preserve neutral evolutionary processes, a prioritisation must secure individuals descended from each of the genetic lineages that comprise each species [@r5]. To accommodate such information into a multi-species conservation planning exercise, species ranges must be partitioned into different groups [eg. using habitat data; @r2] as a pre-processing step to be compatible with existing tools. However, this approach assumes that the biodiversity processes that operate across a species' range can be split into discrete units. Yet data on biodiversity processes is often continuous and hyper-dimensional, and often cannot be reduced to a few categories without significant information loss [@r218].

<!-- aims of this paper -->
Today, one of the key issues in reserve selection is the lack of a unifying decision support tool that can accommodate data on biodiversity patterns and processes in a multi-species context. To fill this void, we present the \texttt{rapr R} package. This \texttt{R} package uses novel formulations of the reserve selection problem to provide decision makers with the tools to generate prioritisations that preserve biodiversity patterns and processes. We also provide a tutorial showcasing the functionality of this \texttt{R} package using simulated species and a case-study conservation planning scenario in Queensland, Australia.

## Problem formulations
The \texttt{rapr R} package uses two novel formulations of the reserve selection problem to identify cost-effective prioritisations. These formulations share many constraints and variables. For brevity, the variables used by both formulations will be defined. Biodiversity features are defined as the entity(s) that the prioritisation is required to preserve (eg. species, populations). Spatial attributes are defined as the variation across the species' range that the prioritisation is required to sample. They can be intrinsic (eg. genetic or trait variation) or extrinsic (eg. environmental variation) to the feature. These attributes should be related to the biodiversity processes that the decision maker aims to preserve.

Each attribute is conceptualised as a space. This space is termed an attribute space. Each planning unit is thought to occupy a single point inside each space. For example, a decision maker may require a prioritisation that preserves populations along climatic gradients. To achieve this, the decision maker might use an "climatic" attribute space with dimensions relating to mean annual temperature ($^{\circ}$C) and precipitation (mm). Any given combination of temperature and precipitation may be conceived as a point in this environmental space. By associating planning units with climatic data, they can be mapped from geographic space to this environmental attribute space.

Demand points are points that also exist in an attribute space. They are designated by the decision maker to indicate regions of the attribute space that should be preserved in the prioritisation (see below for discussion on how demand points can be generated for real-world datasets). The amount of variation in the attribute space that a prioritisation secures is a function of the distance between each demand point and each selected planning unit in the attribute space. The shorter the distances between the demand points and the planning units; the better the prioritisation is at securing the variation in the spatial attribute. To convert these amounts to a proportion--a meaningful unit for a decision maker--the distances between the selected planing units and the demand points are scaled by the distances between the demand points to the centroid of the demand points. In any attribute space there may exist points that are impossible (eg. mean annual rainfall -5 mm), do not occur in the study area (eg. mean annual temperature 30$^{\circ}$C in Antarctica). Additionally, there may be some regions that are desirable for some features and undesirable for others (eg. conditions known to be outside the physiological tolerance of a species). Thus a different set of demand points and weights are used for each attribute space and each feature. By placing demand points in desirable regions of an attribute space for a given feature, the decision maker can ensure that prioritisations secure the feature in planning units with spatial attributes that are desirable for that feature.

To illustrate these concepts, we will briefly describe a conservation planning scenario example involving an attribute spaces and demand points. A decision maker may wish to develop a prioritisation for a single species. This species has four populations in the study area. However, the decision maker can only afford to preserve three population. The decision maker needs to preserve the adaptive landscape of the species, and preserve populations inhabiting different environmental conditions. To describe environmental variaiton, the decision maker obtained data on the environmental conditions (rainfall (ml) and temperature ($^{\circ}$C)) where each population was found. The decision maker then used this environmental data to construct a two-dimensional environmental attribute space. Next, the decision maker generated demand points as equi-distant points between the range of values where the populations were found [$\pm$ 20% to avoid edge effects; @r218]. By comparing the distribution of the demand points to the distribution of the populations in the attribute space, the decision maker can identify a suitable prioritisation (Figure 1). We can see that if the decision maker preserves both populations $A$ and $C$, they will effectively "double-up" on the same environmental characteristics, and in turn their waste resources. Instead, a more representative sample of the intra-specific variation could be preserved by securing populations $A$, $B$, and $D$. This example demonstrates how the inclusion of biodiversity processes can guide the reserve selection process.

The problem formulations used to guide reserve selection in the \texttt{rapr R} package are based on a combination of the \texttt{Marxan} reserve selection problem and the uncapacitated facility location problems [@r451]. All mathematical terms defined hereafter are described in Table S1 for convenience. For convenience, the cardinality of sets will be denoted using the same symbol used to denote the variable. Define $F$ to be the set of features (indexed by $f$). Let $J$ be a set of planning units (indexed by $j$). Also, let $A_j$ denote the area, and $C_j$ denote the cost of preserving planning unit $j \in J$. To assess the extent to which each feature is secured in a given prioritisation, let $q_{fj}$ denote the probability of feature $f$ occupying planning unit $j$. The level of fragmentation associated with a prioritisation is parametrised as the net exposed boundary length. Let the shared edges between each planning unit $j \in J$ and $k \in J$ be $e_{jk}$.

Let $S$ denote a set of attribute spaces (indexed by $s$). Each $j \in J$ is associated with spatially explicit data that represent coordinates for each attribute space $s \in S$. Let $I_{fsi}$ denote a set of demand points (indexed by $i$) for each feature $f \in F$ and each attribute space $s \in S$. Let $\lambda_{fsi}$ denote the weighting for each demand point $i \in I$, $f \in F$ and $s \in S$. Let $d_{fsij}$ denote the distance between each demand point $i \in I$ and each planning unit $j \in J$ for each feature $f \in F$ and attribute space $s \in S$. To describe the inherent variation in the distribution of demand points for feature $f$ and space $s$, let $\delta_{fsi}$ denote the distance between each demand point $i \in I$ and the centroid of the demand points. Demand points with greater weight $\lambda_{fsi}$ are more important, and the optimal solution will be likely to select planning units close to highly weighted demand points. As a consequence, the decision maker will need to choose an appropriate weighting for each demand point. The decision maker will also need to choose an appropriate distance metric for each attribute space. For example, Euclidean, Mahalanobis [@r398], Bray-Curtis, or other distance metrics may be appropriate given the nature of the attribute space [evaluated in @r449].

Targets are used to ensure that prioritisations adequately preserve each species. Amount-based targets are used to ensure that the total amount of habitat preserved is sufficient. Let $T_f$ denote the expected amount of area that needs to be preserved for each feature $f \in F$. Space-based targets ensure that a sufficient proportion of the intra-specific variation is secured. Let $\tau_{fs}$ denote the space-based targets for feature $f \in F$ and attribute space $a \in A$. For convenience, these both types of targets are expressed as proportions in the \texttt{R} package.

The \texttt{R} package provides two formulations for reserve selection. They are based on the unreliable [@r451] and reliable uncapacitated facility location [@r16] problems. The key difference between them is that the reliable formulation explicitly considers the probability that the planning units are occupied when calculating the proportion of variation that a given solution secures, whereas the unreliable formulation does not.

### Unreliable formulation
In the unreliable formulation, the control variables are the $B$, $T_{s}$, and $\tau_{sa}$ variables.

\begin{align*}
T_s &= \text{amount target for feature $f$} \tag{1a}\\
%
\tau_{sa} &= \text{representation target for feature $f$ in attribute space $a$} \tag{1b}\\
%
B &= \text{boundary length modifier (BLM): penalise fragmented solutions} \tag{1c}\\
\end{align*}

The decision variables are the $X_j$ and $Y_{fsij}$ variables.

\begin{align*}
X_j
	&= \begin{cases}
		1, & \parbox{25em}{if planning unit $j$ is selected for conservation action} \tag{2a} \\
		0, & \parbox{25em}{otherwise} \\
	\end{cases} \\
%
Y_{fsij} &= \begin{cases}
		1, & \parbox{25em}{if demand point $i$ is assigned to planning unit $j$ for feature $f$ in space $s$. } \tag{2b} \\
		0, & \parbox{25em}{otherwise} \\
	\end{cases} \\
\end{align*}

Each demand point $i \in I$ for feature $f \in F$ and space $s \in S$ is assigned to a selected planning unit $J$ where $X_j = 1$. The weighted distance between the demand point and its assigned planning unit $\lambda_{fsi} d_{fsij}$ is used to assess how well the demand point is represented in  a given solution. Generally, demand points are assigned to the closest selected planning units (unless particularly low space-based targets are used).

The unreliable formulation (URAP) is a defined as a multi-objective optimisation problem.

\begin{align*}
& \text{(URAP)} & \text{Min } & \sum_{j=0}^{J-1} \left( X_j C_j \right) + \sum_{j=0}^{J-1} \sum_{k=j}^{J-1} X_j \left( 1-X_k \right) \left( B e_{jk} \right) + & & \tag{3a} \\
%
& & \text{s.t. } & \sum_{j=0}^{J-1} A_j q_{fj} \geq T_{f} & \forall & 0 \leq f \leq F-1 \tag{3b}\\
%
& & & 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{I-1} \sum_{j=0}^{J-1} \left( \lambda_{fsi} d_{fsij} Y_{fsij} \right)^2}{\sum_{i=0}^{I-1} \left( \lambda_{fsi} \delta_{fsi} \right)^2 } \geq \tau_{fs}  & \forall & 0 \leq f \leq F-1, \tag{3c}\\
& & & & & 0 \leq s \leq S-1\\
%
& & & \sum_{j=0}^{J-1} Y_{fsij} = 1 & \forall & 0 \leq f \leq F-1, \tag{3d}\\
& & & & & 0 \leq s \leq S-1, \\
& & & & & 0 \leq i \leq I-1\\
%
& & & Y_{fsij} \leq X_j & \forall & 0 \leq f \leq F-1, \tag{3e}\\
& & & & & 0 \leq s \leq S-1, \\
& & & & & 0 \leq i \leq I-1,\\
& & & & & 0 \leq j \leq J-1\\
%
& & & X_j, Y_{fsij} \in {0,1} & \forall & 0 \leq f \leq F-1, \tag{3f}\\
& & & & & 0 \leq s \leq S-1,\\
& & & & & 0 \leq i \leq I-1\\
%
\end{align*}

The objective function (3a) determines the utility of a given prioritisation: a combination of the total cost of a prioritisation and how fragmented it is. Constraints (3b) ensure that all the amount-based targets are met. Constraints (3c) ensure that all the space-based targets are met for each feature and each attribute space. For each feature and attribute space, the total weighted distance between the demand points and their closest selected planning units is calculated ($\lambda_{fsi} d_{fsij} Y_{fsij}$). This total weighted distance is then scaled by the inherent variation in the demand points ($\lambda_{fsi} \delta_{fsi}$). The resulting fraction yields a proportion conceptually similar to the statistical $R^2$ value, and the constraints ensure that this proportion must be greater than or equal to the space-based target. Constraints (3d) ensure that only one planning unit is assigned to each demand point. Constraints (3e) ensure that demand points are only assigned to selected planning units. Constraints (3f) ensure that the $X$ and $Y$ variables are binary.

### Reliable formulation
The reliable formulation explicitly considers the probability that the planning units are inhabited. As a consequence, it may deliver prioritisations that will sufficiently represent an attribute space even if the features do not inhabit several of the planning units when the prioritisation is implemented. This behaviour is achieved by siting back-up planning units near selected planning units with low occupancy probabilities in the attribute space(s). To ensure that prioritisations are robust against multiple planning units being uninhabited, the problem assigns planning units at multiple backup levels. 

Backup levels levels are defined as $r$-levels [similar to failure levels in @r18]. The first backup $r$-level is used to calculate the level of representation when all of the selected planning units are occupied by all $f \in F$. For this scenario, the closest selected planning unit to each demand point $i$ for attribute space $s$ is assigned at $r$-level$=0$. This scenario essentially represents $Y_{fsij}$ in the unreliable formulation. The second backup $r$-level is used to assess the level of representation when the closest planning unit to each demand point $i$ is unoccupied. For this scenario, the second closest planning units are assigned at $r$-level$=1$. The third backup $r$-level is used to assess representation when the first two closest planning units are unoccupied. The third closest planning units are assigned at $r$-level$=2$. Continuing on, in this manner, the selected planning units in a prioritisation are assigned to each demand point $i \in I$, attribute space $s \in S$, and each feature $f \in F$ at an $r$-level.

A final backup $r$-level when $r=R$ is used to assess the level of representation when the features $f \in F$ do not occupy any selected planning units in a prioritisation. Each demand point $i \in I$ for each $s \in S$ and $f \in F$ is assigned to an "imaginary" planning unit $j=J$ at $r=R$. The distance variables associated with this imaginary planning unit $d_{fsiJ}$ denote the loss of biological value associated with failing to secure a representative sample of feature $f$ in attribute space $s$. However, the $d$ variables are in distance units which are meaningless in this context. Thus these variables are calculated using a failure multiplier ($M$) and the maximum distance between the planning units and the demand points for $f \in F$, $s \in S$ (4).

\begin{align*}
& d_{fsiJ} = M \max\limits_{0 \leq i \leq I-1, 0 \leq j \leq J-1} d_{fsij} & \forall & 0 \leq f \leq F-1, \tag{4} \\
& & & 0 \leq s \leq S-1\\
\end{align*}

Moderately-sized conservation planning problems often include several thousand planning units. It is currently not be feasible to solve this problem when considering all possible failure scenarios. As a consequence, the $R$ variable can be any $1 \leq R \leq J-1$. For instance, when $R=3$ only 2 backup levels are considered in addition to the final backup level. Cui et al. [-@r16] found that $R=5$ yields similar solutions to $R=J$ when $J >> 5$. However, in most costs the decision maker will likely be limited to $R=1$ to obtain prioritisations in a feasible amount of time.

In the reliable formulation, the control variables are the $B$ (1a), $T_{s}$ (1b), $\tau_{sa}$ (1c), $R$, and $M$ variables.

\begin{align*}
R &= \parbox{25em}{number of failure levels} \tag{5a} \\
%
M &= \parbox{25em}{failure multiplier} \tag{5b}\\
%
\end{align*}

The decision variables are the $X_j$ (2a), $Y_{fsijr}$, $P_{fsijr}$ variables.

\begin{align*}
Y_{fsijr} &= \begin{cases}
		1, & \parbox{25em}{if demand point $i$ is assigned to planning unit $j$ for feature $f$ in space $s$ at back-up level $r$. } \tag{6a} \\
		0, & \parbox{25em}{otherwise} \\
	\end{cases} \\
%
P_{fsijr} &= \parbox{25em}{probability that demand point $i$ is assigned to planning unit $j$ at back-up level $r$ for feature $f$ and space $s$} \tag{6a}\\
%
\end{align*}

The reliable formulation (RRAP) is a multi-objective optimisation problem.

\begin{align*}
& \text{(RRAP)} & \text{Min } & \text{(3a)}\\
%
& & \text{s.t. } & \text{(3b)}\\
%
& & & 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{I-1} \sum_{j=0}^{J-1} \left( \lambda_{fsi} d_{fsij} P_{fsijr} Y_{fsij} \right)^2}{\sum_{i=0}^{I-1} \left( \lambda_{fsi} \delta_{fsi} \right)^2 } \geq T_{fs}  & \forall & 0 \leq f \leq F-1, \tag{7a}\\
& & & & & 0 \leq s \leq S-1\\
%
& & & \sum_{j=0}^{J-1} Y_{fsijr} = 1 & \forall & 0 \leq f \leq F-1, \tag{7b}\\

%

\end{align*}


The objective function for the reliable formulation is the same as for the unreliable formation (3a). Similar to the unreliable formulation, constraints (3b) and (7a) ensure that the amount-based and space-based targets are met. Constraint (7b--7c) ensure that each planning unit is only assigned to one backup $r$-level for $i \in I$. Constraints (7d) ensure that only selected planning units are assigned to demand points $i \in I$. Constraints (7e) ensure that the imaginary planning unit is always assigned to the highest backup $r$-level. Constraints (7f--7g) determine the probability that planning unit $j$ will be used to sample demand point $i \in I$ for $s \in S$ and $f \in F$ [see @r16 for more information]. Constraints (7h) ensure that the $X$ and $Y$ variables are binary.

### Optimisation
The unreliable and reliable formulations are non-linear. However, the non-linear components can be linearised using existing techniques. First, the expression $X_j X_k$ in (3a) can be linearised using methods described by Beyer et al. [-@r426]. Second, the expression $P_{fsijr} Y_{jsijr}$ in (7a) can be linearised using techniques described by Sherali and Alameddine [-@r20] as implemented in Cui et al. [-@r16]. Linearised versions of the problems can be solved using commercial exact algorithm solvers.

The \texttt{rapr} R package provides functions to express conservation planning data as an optimisation problems using linearised versions of the unreliable and reliable formulations. These optimisation problems can then be solved to generate prioritisations using the commercial \texttt{Gurobi} software suite (\url{http://www.gurobi.com}).

### Simple simulated species
#### Data
To investigate the behaviour of the problem, we will generate prioritisations for three simulated species. We will use the unreliable formulation of the problem to understand the basics, and later move onto the reliable formulation. The first species (termed 'uniform') will represent a hyper-generalist. This species will inhabit all areas with equal probability. The second species (termed 'normal') will represent a species with a single range core. The third species (termed 'bimodal') will represent a species with two distinct ecotypes, each with their own range core. To reduce computational time for this example, we will use a 10 $\times$ 10 grid of square planning units.

```{r}
# make planning units
sim_pus <- sim.pus(100L)

# simulate species distributions
sim_spp <- lapply(
	c('uniform', 'normal', 'bimodal'),
	sim.species,
  n=1,
  x=sim_pus,
  res=1
)
```

Let's see what these species' distributions look like.

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=2.5, fig.cap="Distribution of three simulated species. Each square represents a planning unit. The colour of each square denotes the probability that individuals from each species occupy it."}
# plot species
plot(
	stack(sim_spp),
	main=c('Uniform species','Normal species','Bimodal species'),
	addfun=function(){lines(sim_pus)},
	nc=3
)
```

Next, we will generate a set of demand points. To understand the effects of probabilities and weights on the demand points, we will generate the demand points in geographic space. These demand points will be the centroids of the planning units. Additionally, we will use the same set of demand points for each species and only vary the weights of the demand points between species. **Note that we are only using the same distribution of demand points for different species for teaching purposes. It is strongly recommended to use different demand points for different species in real-world conservation planning exercises.**  See the case-study section of this tutorial for examples on how to generate suitable demand points.

```{r}
# generate coordinates for pus/demand points
pu_coords <- gCentroid(sim_pus, byid=TRUE)

# calculate weights
sim_dps <- lapply(
	sim_spp,
	function(x) {
		return(extract(x, pu_coords))
	}
)

# create demand point objects
sim_dps <- lapply(
	sim_dps,
	function(x) {
		return(
			DemandPoints(
				SimplePoints(pu_coords@coords),
				c(x)
			)
		)
	}
)
```

Now, we will construct a `RapUnsolved` object to store our input data and parameters. This contains all the information to generate prioritisations.

```{r}
## create RapUnreliableOpts object
# this stores parameters for the unreliable formulation problem (ie. BLM)
sim_ro <- RapUnreliableOpts()

## create RapData object
# create data.frame with species info
species <- data.frame(
  name=c('uniform', 'normal', 'bimodal')
)

## create data.frame with species and space targets
# amount targets at 20% (denoted with target=0)
# space targets at 20% (denoted with target=1)
targets <- expand.grid(
  species=1:3,
  target=0:1,
  proportion=0.2
)

# calculate probability of each species in each pu
pu_probabilities <- calcSpeciesAverageInPus(sim_pus, stack(sim_spp))

## create AttributeSpace object
# this stores the coordinates of the planning units in an attribute space
# and the coordinates and weights of demand points in the space
attr_space <- AttributeSpace(
  SimplePoints(pu_coords@coords),
  sim_dps
)

# generate boundary data information
boundary <- calcBoundaryData(sim_pus)

## create RapData object
# this stores all the input data for the prioritisation
sim_rd <- RapData(
  sim_pus@data,
  species,
  targets,
  pu_probabilities,
  list(attr_space),
  boundary,
  SpatialPolygons2PolySet(sim_pus)
)

## create RapUnsolved object
# this stores all the input data and parameters needed to generate prioritisations
sim_ru <- RapUnsolved(sim_ro, sim_rd)
```

#### Single-species prioritisations
##### Amount-based targets
To investigate the effects of space-based targets, we will generate a prioritisation for each species using only amount-based targets and compare them to prioritisations generated using amount- and space-based targets. To start off, we will generate a prioritisation for the uniform species using amount-based targets. To do this, we will generate a new `sim_ru` object by subsetting out the data for the uniform species from the `sim_ru` object. Then, we will update the targets in the new object. Finally, we will solve the object to generate a prioritisation that fulfills the targets for minimal cost.

```{r}
# create new object with just the uniform species
sim_ru_s1 <- spp.subset(sim_ru, 'uniform')

# update amount targets to 20% and space targets to 0%
sim_ru_s1 <- update(sim_ru_s1, amount.target=0.2, space.target=NA, solve=FALSE)
```

```{r, eval=use.Gurobi}
# solve problem to identify prioritisation
sim_rs_s1_amount <- solve(sim_ru_s1)
```

```{r, eval=!use.Gurobi, include=FALSE}
sim_rs_s1_amount <- solve(sim_ru_s1, b=cache$sim_rs_s1_amount)
```

```{r}
## show summary
# note the format for this is similar to that used by Marxan
# see ?rapr::summary for details on this table
summary(sim_rs_s1_amount)

# show amount held
amount.held(sim_rs_s1_amount)

# show space held
space.held(sim_rs_s1_amount)
```

Now that we have generated a prioritisation, let's see what it looks like. We can use the `spp.plot` method to see how the prioritisation overlaps with the uniform species' distribution. Note that since all planning units have equal probabilities for this species, all planning units have the same fill colour. 

```{r, fig.height=5.5, fig.width=5.5, out.width='3.5in', out.height='3.5in', fig.align='center',fig.cap="A prioritisation for the uniformly distributed species generated using amount-based targets (20\\%). Sqaures represent planning units. Planning units with a green border are selected for prioritisation, and their colour denotes the probability they are inhabited by the species."}
# plot the prioritisation and the uniform species' distribution
spp.plot(sim_rs_s1_amount, 1, main='Uniform species')
```

The prioritisation for the uniform species appears to be just a random selection of planning units. This behavior is due to the fact that any prioritisation with 20 planning units is optimal. By relying on just amount targets, this solution may preserve a section of the species' range core, or just focus on the range margin, or some random part of its range--no emphasis is directed towards preserving different parts of the species' range. This behavior highlights a fundamental limitation of just using amount-based targets. In the absence of additional criteria, conventional reserve selection problems do not contain any additional information to identify the most effective prioritisation.

Now, we will generate a prioritisation for the normally distributed species using amount-based targets. We will use a similar process to what we used for the uniformly distributed species, but for brevity, we will use code to generate solutions immediately after updating the object.

```{r}
# create new object with just the normal species
sim_ru_s2 <- spp.subset(sim_ru, 'normal')
```

```{r, eval=use.Gurobi}
# update amount targets to 20% and space targets to 0% and solve it
sim_rs_s2_amount <- update(sim_ru_s2, amount.target=0.2, space.target=NA, solve=TRUE)
```

```{r, eval=!use.Gurobi, include=FALSE}
# update amount targets to 20% and space targets to 0% and solve it
sim_rs_s2_amount <- update(sim_ru_s2, amount.target=0.2, space.target=NA, solve=FALSE)
sim_rs_s2_amount <-solve(
	sim_rs_s2_amount,
	b=cache$sim_rs_s2_amount
)
```

```{r}
# show summary
summary(sim_rs_s2_amount)

# show amount held
amount.held(sim_rs_s2_amount)

# show space held
space.held(sim_rs_s2_amount)
```

Now let's visualise the prioritisation we made for the normal species.

```{r, fig.height=5.5, fig.width=5.5, out.width='3.5in', out.height='3.5in', fig.align='center', fig.cap="A prioritisation for the normally distributed species generated using amount-based targets (20\\%). See Figure 3 caption for conventions."}
# plot the prioritisation and the normal species' distribution
spp.plot(sim_rs_s2_amount, 1, main='Normal species')
```

The amount-based prioritisation for the normal species focuses only on the species' range core. This prioritisation fails to secure any peripheral parts of the species' distribution. As a consequence, it may miss out on populations with novel adaptations to environmental conditions along the species' range margin.

Now, let's generate an amount-based target for the bimodally distributed species view it.

```{r}
# create new object with just the bimodal species
sim_ru_s3 <- spp.subset(sim_ru, 'bimodal')
```

```{r, eval={use.Gurobi}}
# update amount targets to 20% and space targets to 0% and solve it
sim_rs_s3_amount <- update(sim_ru_s3, amount.target=0.2, space.target=NA)
```

```{r, eval=!use.Gurobi, include=FALSE}
# update amount targets to 20% and space targets to 0% and solve it
sim_rs_s3_amount <- update(sim_ru_s3, amount.target=0.2, space.target=NA, solve=FALSE)
sim_rs_s3_amount <- solve(
	sim_rs_s3_amount,
	b=cache$sim_rs_s3_amount
)
```

```{r, fig.height=5.5, fig.width=5.5, out.width='3.5in', out.height='3.5in', fig.align='center', fig.cap="A prioritisation for the bimodally distributed species generated using amount-based targets (20\\%). See Figure 3 caption for conventions."}
# plot the prioritisation and the bimodal species' distribution
spp.plot(sim_rs_s3_amount, 1, main='Bimodal species')
```

```{r}
# show summary
summary(sim_rs_s3_amount)

# show amount held
amount.held(sim_rs_s3_amount)

# show space held
space.held(sim_rs_s3_amount)
```

The amount-based prioritisation for the bimodally distributed species only selects planning units in the bottom left corner of the study area. This prioritisation only preserves individuals belonging to one of the two ecotypes. As a consequence, this prioritisation may fail to preserve a representative sample of the genetic variation found inside this species.

##### Amount-based and space-based targets
Now that we have generated a prioritisation for each species using only amount-based targets, we will generate a prioritisations using both amount-based and space-targets. To do this we will update the space targets in our amount-based prioritisations to 85%, and store the new prioritisations in new objects.

First, let's do this for the uniform species.

```{r, eval=use.Gurobi}
# make new prioritisation
sim_rs_s1_space <- update(sim_rs_s1_amount, amount.target=0.2, space.target=0.85)
```

```{r, eval=!use.Gurobi, include=FALSE}
# make new prioritisation
sim_rs_s1_space <- update(sim_rs_s1_amount, amount.target=0.2, space.target=0.5, solve=FALSE)
sim_rs_s1_space <- solve(
	sim_rs_s1_space,
	b=cache$sim_rs_s1_space
)
```

```{r}
# show summary
summary(sim_rs_s1_space)

# show amount held
amount.held(sim_rs_s1_space)

# show space held
space.held(sim_rs_s1_space)
```

Let's take a look at the prioritisation for the uniform species with amount-based and space-based targets. Then, let's compare the solutions for the amount-based prioritisation with the new prioritisation using both amount and space targets.

```{r, fig.height=5.5, fig.width=5.5, out.width='3.5in', out.height='3.5in', fig.align='center', fig.cap="A prioritisation for the uniformly distributed species generated using amount-based targets (20\\%) and space-based targets (85\\%). See Figure 3 caption for conventions."}
# plot the prioritisation and the uniform species' distribution
spp.plot(sim_rs_s1_space, 'uniform', main='Uniform species')
```

```{r, fig.height=5.5, fig.width=5.5, out.width='3.5in', out.height='3.5in', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Difference between two prioritisations for the uniformly distributed species. Prioritisation $X$ was generated using just amount-based targets (20\\%), and prioritisation $Y$ was generated using an additional space-based target (85\\%)."}
# plot the difference between old and new prioritisations
plot(sim_rs_s1_amount, sim_rs_s1_space, 1, 1, main='Difference between solutions')
```

Here we can see that by including a space-target, the prioritisation is spread out evenly across the species' distribution. Unlike the amount-based prioritisation, this prioritisation samples all the different parts of the species' distribution.

Now, let's generate a prioritisation for the normally distributed species that considers amount-based and space-based targets. Then, let's visualise the new prioritisation and compare it to the old amount-based prioritisation.

```{r, eval=use.Gurobi}
# make new prioritisation
sim_rs_s2_space <- update(sim_rs_s2_amount, amount.target=0.2, space.target=0.85)
```

```{r, eval=!use.Gurobi, include=FALSE}
# make new prioritisation
sim_rs_s2_space <- update(sim_rs_s2_amount, amount.target=0.2, space.target=0.85, solve=FALSE)
sim_rs_s2_space <- solve(
	sim_rs_s2_space, 
	b=cache$sim_rs_s2_space
)
```

```{r}
# show summary
summary(sim_rs_s2_space)

# show amount held
amount.held(sim_rs_s2_space)

# show space held
space.held(sim_rs_s2_space)
```

```{r, fig.height=5.5, fig.width=5.5, out.width='3.5in', out.height='3.5in', fig.align='center', fig.cap="A prioritisation for the normally distributed species generated using amount-based targets (20\\%) and space-based targets (85\\%). See Figure 3 caption for conventions."}

# plot the prioritisation and the normal species' distribution
spp.plot(sim_rs_s2_space, 'normal', main='Normal species')
```

```{r, fig.height=5.5, fig.width=5.5, out.width='3.5in', out.height='3.5in', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Difference between two prioritisations for the normally distributed species. See Figure 7 caption for conventions."}
# plot the difference between old and new prioritisations
plot(sim_rs_s2_amount, sim_rs_s2_space, 1, 1, main='Difference between solutions')
```

We can see by using both amount-based and space-based targets we can obtain a prioritisation that secures both the species' range core and parts of its range margin. As a consequence, it may capture any novel adaptations found along the species' range margin--unlike the amount-based prioritisation.

Finally, let's generate a prioritisation for the bimodal species using amount-based and space-based targets.

```{r, eval=use.Gurobi}
# make new prioritisation
sim_rs_s3_space <- update(sim_rs_s3_amount, amount.target=0.2, space.target=0.85)
```

```{r, eval=!use.Gurobi, include=FALSE}
# make new prioritisation
sim_rs_s3_space <- update(sim_rs_s3_amount, amount.target=0.2, space.target=0.85, solve=FALSE)
sim_rs_s3_space <- solve(
	sim_rs_s3_space, 
	b=cache$sim_rs_s3_space
)
```
```{r}
# show summary
summary(sim_rs_s3_space)

# show amount held
amount.held(sim_rs_s3_space)

# show space held
space.held(sim_rs_s3_space)

```{r, fig.height=5.5, fig.width=5.5, out.width='3.5in', out.height='3.5in', fig.align='center', fig.cap="A prioritisation for the normally distributed species generated using amount-based targets (20\\%) and space-based targets (85\\%). See Figure 3 caption for conventions."}
# plot the prioritisation and the bimodal species' distribution
spp.plot(sim_rs_s3_space, 'bimodal', main='Bimodal species')
```

```{r, fig.height=5.5, fig.width=5.5, out.width='3.5in', out.height='3.5in', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Difference between two prioritisations for the bimodally distributed species. See Figure 7 caption for conventions."}
# plot the difference between old and new prioritisations
plot(sim_rs_s3_amount, sim_rs_s3_space, 1, 1, main='Difference between solutions')
```

Earlier we found that the amount-based prioritisation only preserved individuals from a single ecotype, and would have failed to adequately preserve the intra-specific variation for this species. However, here we can see that by including space-based targets, we can develop prioritisations that secure individuals belonging to both ecotypes. This new prioritisation is much more effective at sampling the intra-specific variation for this species.

Overall, these results demonstrate that under the simplest of conditions, the use of space-based targets can improve prioritisations. However, these prioritisations were each generated for a single species. Prioritisations generated using multiple species may do a better job at preserving the intra-specific variation for individuals species by preserving them in different parts of their range. We will investigate this in the next section.

#### Multi-species prioritisations
##### Effects of including space-based targets
So far we have generated prioritisations using only a single species at a time. However, real world prioritisations are often generated using multiple species to ensure that they preserve a comprehensive set of biodiversity. Here, we will generate multi-species prioritisations that preserve all three of the simulated species. First, we will generate a prioritisation using amount-based targets that only aims to preserve 20% of the area they occupy. Then, we will generate a prioritisation that also incoperate space-based targets to also preserve 85% of their geographic distribution. We will then compare the two prioritisations.

```{r, eval=use.Gurobi}
# make prioritisations
sim_mrs_amount <- update(
	sim_ru,
	amount.target=c(0.2,0.2,0.2),
	space.target=c(0,0,0)
)

sim_mrs_space <- update(
	sim_ru,
	amount.target=c(0.2,0.2,0.2),
	space.target=c(0.85, 0.85, 0.85)
)
```

```{r, eval=!use.Gurobi, include=FALSE}
# make prioritisations
sim_mrs_amount <- update(sim_ru, amount.target=c(0.2,0.2,0.2), space.target=c(0,0,0), solve=FALSE)
sim_mrs_amount <- solve(
	sim_mrs_amount,
	b=cache$sim_mrs_amount
)

sim_mrs_space <- update(sim_ru, amount.target=c(0.2,0.2,0.2), space.target=c(0.85, 0.85, 0.85), solve=FALSE)
sim_mrs_space <- solve(
	sim_mrs_space,
	b=cache$sim_mrs_space
)
```

```{r}
# show summaries
summary(sim_mrs_amount)
summary(sim_mrs_space)

# show amount held for each prioritisation
amount.held(sim_mrs_amount)
amount.held(sim_mrs_space)

# show space held for each prioritisation
space.held(sim_mrs_amount)
space.held(sim_mrs_space)
```

```{r, fig.height=5.5, fig.width=5.5, out.width='3.5in', out.height='3.5in', fig.align='center', fig.cap="A multi-species prioritisation for the uniformly, normally, and bimodally distributed species generated using just amount-based targets (20\\%). Squares represent planning units. Dark green planning units are selected for preservation."}
# plot multi-species prioritisation with amount-based targets
plot(sim_mrs_amount, 1, main='Amount-based targets')
```

```{r, fig.height=5.5, fig.width=5.5, out.width='3.5in', out.height='3.5in', fig.align='center', fig.cap="A multi-species prioritisation for the uniformly, normally, and bimodally distributed species generated using amount-based targets (20\\%) and space-based targets (85\\%). See Figure 12 caption for conventions."}
# plot multi-species prioritisation with amount- and space-based targets
plot(sim_mrs_space, 1, main='Amount and space-based targets')
```

```{r, fig.height=5.5, fig.width=5.5, out.width='3.5in', out.height='3.5in', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Difference between two multi-species prioritisations. See Figure 7 caption for conventions."}
# difference between the two prioritisations
plot(sim_mrs_amount, sim_mrs_space, 1, 1, main='Difference between solutions')
```

Here we can see that the inclusion of space-based targets changes which planning units are selected for prioritisation, but also the number of planning units that are selected. The amount-based prioritisation is comprised of `r sum(selections(sim_mrs_amount)==1)` units, and the space-based prioritisation is comprised of `r sum(selections(sim_mrs_space)==1)` units. This result suggests that an adequate and representative prioritisation can be achieved for only a minor increase in cost.

##### Uncertainty in species' distributions
The unreliable formulation does not consider the probability that the planning units are occupied by features when calculating how well a given solution secures a representative sample of an attribute space. Thus solutions identified using the unreliable formulation may select regions of an attribute space for a species using planning units that only have a small chance of being inhabited. As a consequence, if the prioritisation is implemented, it may fail to secure regions of an attribute space if individuals do not inhabit these planning units, and ultimately fail to fulfil the space-based targets.

A simple solution to this issue would be to ensure that planning units cannot be assigned to demand points if they have a low probability of occupancy. This can be achieved by setting a probability threshold for planning units, such that planning units with a probability of occupancy below the threshold are effectively set to zero.

```{r, eval={use.Gurobi}}
# make new prioritisation with probability threshold of 0.1 for each species
sim_mrs_space2 <- solve(
	prob.subset(
		sim_mrs_space,
		species=1:3,
		threshold=c(0.1,0.1,0.1)
	)
)
```

```{r, eval=!use.Gurobi, include=FALSE}
# make new prioritisation with probability threshold of 0.1 for each species
sim_mrs_space2 <- solve(
	prob.subset(
		sim_mrs_space,
		species=1:3,
		threshold=c(0.1,0.1,0.1)
	),
	b=cache$sim_mrs_space2
)
```

```{r}
# show summary
summary(sim_mrs_space2)
```

```{r, fig.height=5.5, fig.width=5.5, out.width='3.5in', out.height='3.5in', fig.align='center', fig.cap="A multi-species prioritisation for the uniformly, normally, and bimodally distributed species generated using amount-based targets (20\\%) and space-based targets (85\\%). This priorititisation was generated to be robust against low occupancy probabilities, by preventing planning units with low probabilities from being used to represent demand points. See Figure 12 caption for conventions."}
# plot prioritisation
plot(sim_mrs_space2, 1)
```

```{r, fig.height=5.5, fig.width=5.5, out.width='3.5in', out.height='3.5in', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Difference between two multi-species prioritisations. See Figure 7 caption for conventions."}
# difference between prioritisations that use and do not use thresholds
plot(sim_mrs_space2, sim_mrs_space, 1, 1, main='Difference between solutions')
```

But this method requires setting somewhat arbitrary thresholds. A more robust solution to this issue is to actually use the probability that species occupy planning units to generate the prioritisations. This is what the reliable formulation does. First we will try and generate a solution using existing targets and the reliable formulation. To reduce computational time, we will set the maximum backup $R$-level to 1.

```{r}
# make new prioritisation using reliable formulation
sim_mrs_space3 <- try(update(sim_mrs_space, formulation='reliable', max.r.level=1L))
```

However, this fails. The reason why we cannot generate a prioritisation that fulfills these targets is because even the solution that contains all the planning units is still insufficient when we consider probabilities. The negative maximum targets printed in the error message indicate that planning units have low probabilities of occupancy. To fulfill the targets, we must obtain more planning units with higher probabilities of occupancy. We also could attempt resolving the problem using a higher $R$-level. Instead, we will set lower targets and generate solution.

```{r, eval=use.Gurobi}
# make new prioritisation using reliable formulation and reduced targets
sim_mrs_space3 <- update(
	sim_mrs_space,

```

```{r, eval=!use.Gurobi, include=FALSE}
# make new prioritisation using reliable formulation
sim_mrs_space3 <- update(
	sim_mrs_space,
	formulation='reliable',
	max.r.level=1L,
	space.target=-25,
	solve=FALSE
)

sim_mrs_space3 <- solve(
	sim_mrs_space3,
	b=cache$sim_mrs_space3
)
```

```{r}
# show summary

This priorititisation was generated to be robust against low occupancy probabilities, by explicitly using the probability of occupancy data when deriving a solution. See Figure 12 caption for conventions."}
# plot prioritisation

```

```{r, fig.height=5.5, fig.width=5.5, out.width='3.5in', out.height='3.5in', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Difference between two multi-species prioritisations. See Figure 7 caption for conventions."}
# difference between prioritisations based on unreliable and reliable formulation
plot(sim_mrs_space3, sim_mrs_space, 1, 1, main='Difference between solutions')
```

An additional planning unit was selected using the reliable formulation. The prioritisation based on the unreliable formulation had `r sum(selections(sim_mrs_space)==1)` planning units, but the prioritisation based on the reliable formlation has `r sum(selections(sim_mrs_space3)==1)` planning units. This differnce occurs because the reliable formulation needs to ensure that all selected planning units with a low chance of being occupied have a suitable backup planning unit. While the reliable formulation can deliver more robust prioritisations, it takes much longer to solve conservation planning problems expressed using this formulation than the unreliable formulation. As a consequence, the reliable formulation is only feasible for particularly small problems, such as those involving few features and less than several hundred planning units. 

##### Fragmentation
Fragmentation is an important consideration in real-world planning situations. Up until now, we haven't considered the effects of fragmentation on the viability of the prioritisation. As a consequence, our prioritisations have tended to contain planning units without any neighbours. We can use the `BLM` parameter to penalise fragmented solutions.

Let's generate a new prioritisation that heavily penalises fragmentation. Here, we will update the `sim_mrs_amount` object with `BLM` of 100.

```{r, eval=use.Gurobi}
# update prioritisation
sim_mrs_amount_blm <- update(sim_mrs_amount, BLM=100)
```

```{r, eval=!use.Gurobi, include=FALSE}
sim_mrs_amount_blm <- update(sim_mrs_amount, BLM=100, solve=FALSE)
sim_mrs_amount_blm <- solve(
	sim_mrs_amount_blm,
	b=cache$sim_mrs_amount_blm
)
```

```{r}
# show summary of prioritisation
summary(sim_mrs_amount_blm)

# show amount held for each prioritisation
amount.held(sim_mrs_amount_blm)

# show space held for each prioritisation
space.held(sim_mrs_amount_blm)

```{r, fig.height=5.5, fig.width=5.5, out.width='3.5in', out.height='3.5in', fig.align='center', fig.cap="A multi-species prioritisation for the uniformly, normally, and bimodally distributed species generated using only amount-based targets (20\\%). Additionally, this priorititisation was specified to have high connectivity, by using a high $BLM$ parameter. See Figure 12 caption for conventions."}

# plot prioritisation
plot(sim_mrs_amount_blm, 1)
```

```{r, fig.height=5.5, fig.width=5.5, out.width='3.5in', out.height='3.5in', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Difference between two multi-species prioritisations. See Figure 7 caption for conventions."}
# difference between the two prioritisations
plot(sim_mrs_amount_blm, sim_mrs_amount, 1, 1, main='Difference between solutions')
```

Here we can see that the prioritisation generated using a `BLM` parameter of 100 is much more clustered than the prioritisation generated using a `BLM` of 0. In practice, conservation planners will need to try a variety of `BLM` parameters to find a suitable prioritisation.

### Complex simulated species
#### Data
In the previous examples, we have only used Euclidean distances to determine how much of an attribute space is sampled by a prioritisation. However, Euclidean distances can be poor measures of distance for multivariate, binary, or correlated variables [@r449]. As a consequence this may lead to over- or under-estimates of the quality of a given solution.

The \texttt{rapr} R package provides a suite of distance metrics that can be used to calculate spatial representation (see `?AttributeSpace` for available metrics). To illustrate how using different distance metrics can affect the resulting solution, we will generate a new suite of prioritisations using different distance metrics.

First, we will simulate a new species and a three-dimensional attribute space. Note that unlike the previous examples, the attribute space will not be geographic space. Rather, each dimension in the attribute space will have values that map onto geographic space (eg. like climatic variables across the landscape). To add further complexity, we simulate their distributions using Gaussian processes.

```{r, message=FALSE}
# set seed for simulations
set.seed(500)

## simulate planning units
sim_pus <- sim.pus(25L)

# simulate species
sim_gspp <- sim.species(sim_pus, model=RPgauss(), n=1, res=0.1)

# simulate space
sim_gspace <- sim.space(sim_pus, model=RMgauss(scale=3), d=3, res=0.1)

# increment simulated space values by 100 so there are no negative values
# so we can investigate all distance metrics
sim_gspace <- sim_gspace + 100

```

```{r, message=FALSE}
# generate RapUnsolved object containing data to generate prioritisations
sim_ru_gp <- rap(
	sim_pus, sim_gspp, sim_gspace, 
	amount.target=0.2, space.target=0.9,
	n.demand.points=50L, kernel.method='hypervolume',
	include.geographic.space=FALSE, scale=FALSE, solve=FALSE
)
```

Let's visualise the species' distribution and the distribution of the attribute space across geographic space.

```{r, fig.height=5.5, fig.width=5.5, out.width='3.5in', out.height='3.5in', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Distribution map of a species simulated using Gaussian prorceses. See Figure 2 caption for conventions."}
# plot species distribution
plot(
	sim_gspp,
	main='Simulated species',
	col=colorRampPalette(c("#FFFFD9", "#EDF8B1", "#C7E9B4", "#7FCDBB",
		"#41B6C4", "#1D91C0", "#225EA8", "#253494", "#081D58"
	))(100)
)
lines(sim_pus)
```

```{r, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=7, out.width='7in', out.height='2.5in', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Distribution of spatial variables across the species' geographic range. These variables each represent a dimension of a three-dimensional attribute space."}
# plot distribution of each dimension in the attribute space across geographic space
plot(
	sim_gspace,
	main=c('Attribute space (d=1)', 'Attribute space (d=2)', 'Attribute space (d=3)'),
	addfun=function(){lines(sim_pus)},
	nc=3
)
```

#### Distance metrics
For each different distance metric, we will update the `sim_gru` object with the new distance metric, solve it, and store the solution in a list. 

```{r, eval=use.Gurobi, markup='hide'}
# create vector with distance metrics
dist.metrics <- c(
	'euclidean', 'bray', 'manhattan','gower',
	'canberra', 'mahalanobis',
	'jaccard', 'kulczynski'
)

# generate solutions
solutions <- list()
for (i in dist.metrics) {
	solutions[[i]] <- update(sim_ru_gp, distance.metric=i)
}
```

```{r, eval=!use.Gurobi, include=FALSE}
# create vector with distance metrics
dist.metrics <- c(
	'euclidean', 'bray', 'manhattan','gower',
	'canberra', 'mahalanobis',
	'jaccard', 'kulczynski'
)

# generate solutions
solutions <- list()
for (i in dist.metrics) {
	solutions[[i]] <- update(sim_ru_gp, distance.metric=i, solve=FALSE)
	solutions[[i]] <- solve(
		solutions[[i]],
		b=cache$solutions[[i]]
	)
}
```

Now, let's plot the solutions to see how they differ.

```{r, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, markup='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Prioritisations generated using different distance metrics. See Figure 12 for conventions."}
# set plotting window
par(mfrow=c(3,3), mar=c(0, 0, 4.1, 0))

## create plots showing the selected planning units (dark green)
for (i in seq_along(solutions)) {
	# plot i'th solution
	plot(
		sim_pus,
		main=dist.metrics[i],
		col=replace(
			rep('#ccece6',nrow(sim_pus@data)),
			which(selections(solutions[[i]])==1),
			'#00441b'
		),
		axes=FALSE
	)
}

# reset plotting window
par(mfrow=c(1,1), mar=c(5.1, 4.1, 4.1, 2.1))
```

It appears that main difference between the solutions is which planning units get selected in the bottom section of the study area. Some solutions tend to select a lot of planning units in this region (eg. Canberra, Euclidean, Gower, and Manhattan), whereas others select fewer planning units (eg. Bray-Curtis, Jaccard, and Kulczynski). Additionally, the Mahalanobis-based solution contains substantially more planning units than any other solution. Conservation planners should think carefully which distance metric is most appropriate for their attribute spaces. See the discussion section below for guidelines on selecting an appropriate distance metric.


### Case-study examples
#### Overview
Here we will investigate how space-based targets can affect prioritisations using a more realistic dataset. We will generate prioritisations for the four bird species-- [blue-winged kookaburra](http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=1092&gclid=CjwKEAiApYGyBRC-g_jIstuduV8SJABCEzhZoONUy8VlwRZqeFB1Z5M03CjyneIvX8KdVKIPZvckrRoCgJDw_wcB), [brown-backed honeyeater](http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/factsheet/22704394?gclid=CjwKEAiApYGyBRC-g_jIstuduV8SJABCEzhZHxCTcR38YnFlhePYt19gD31lqxxwrMmtIuWFhUwLmRoCGJjw_wcB), [brown falcon](http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3588), [pale-headed rosella](http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=1466)--in Queensland, Australia. This region contains a broad range of different habitats--such as rainforests, woodlands, and deserts--making it ideal for this tutorial. First, we will generate a typical amount-based prioritisation that aims to capture 20% of the species' distributions. Then we will generate a prioritisation that also aims to secure populations in representative parts of the species' distributions in terms of their geographic location and their environmental heterogeneity. To do this we will generate a prioritisation using 20% amount-based targets and 85% space-based targets. Finally, we will compare these prioritisations to Australia's existing protected network.

#### Data
Survey data for the species were obtained from [BirdLife Australia](http://birdlife.org.au/projects/atlas-and-birdata). The survey data was rarefied using a 100 km$^2$ grid, wherein the survey with the greatest number of repeat visits in each grid cell was chosen. To model the distribution of each species, environmental data were obtained at survey location (site). Specifically, [climatic data](http://www.worldclim.org/bioclim) (bio1, bio4, bio15, bio16, bio17) and [classifications of the vegetation at the site](http://www.environment.gov.au/fed/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7BEBBCC6FA-8C13-422A-BCD7-24A9F8B52A9A%7D) were used. Occupancy-detection models [@r443] were fit using Stan [@r444] using manually tuned parameters (adapt deta=0.9, maximum treedepth=20, chains=4 , warmup iterations=1000, total iterations=1500) with five-fold cross-validation. In each replicate, data were partitioned into training and test sites. A full model was fit using quadratic terms for environmental variables in the site-component, and an intercept in the detection-component of the model. The full model was then subject to a step-wise backwards term deletion routine. Terms were retained when their inclusion resulted in a model with a greater area under the curve (AUC) value as calculated using the test data. Maps were generated for each species as an average of the predictions from the best model in each best replicate. To further improve the accuracy of these maps, areas well outside of the species' known distributions were set to 0. For each species, this was achieved by masking out [biogeographic regions](https://www.environment.gov.au/land/nrs/science/ibra) where the species was not observed, and regions that did not have a neighbouring planning unit where the species was observed. The maps were then resampled (10 km$^2$ resolution) and cropped to the study area. The resulting maps are stored in the `cs_spp` object. 

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=5, fig.cap="Distribution map for four Australian bird species. Pixel colours denote probability of occupancy."}
# load data
data(cs_spp)

# remove areas with low occupancy (prob < 0.6)
cs_spp[cs_spp<0.6] <- NA

# plot species' distributions
plot(cs_spp, main=c(
	"Blue-winged kookaburra", "Brown-backed honeyeater", 
	"Brown falcon", "Pale-headed rosella"
))
```

Planning units (50km$^2$ resolution) were generated across Australia, and then clipped to the [Queensland state borders and coastline](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1259.0.30.001?OpenDocument). **Note that we are using excessively coarse planning units so that our examples will complete relatively quickly. In a real-world planning exercise, we would use much finer planning units.** To compare our prioritisations to [Queensland's existing protected area network](http://www.protectedplanet.net/country/AU), this network was intersected with the planning units. Planning units with more than 50% of their area inside a protected area had their status set to 2 ([following conventions in \texttt{Marxan}](http://www.uq.edu.au/marxan/tutorial/module4.html)). Since we do not have cost data, the prioritisations will aim to select the minimum number of planning units required to meet the targets. The planning units are stored in the `cs_pu` object.

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=5, out.width='2.5in', out.height='2.5in', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Planning units for the case-study examples. Polygons denote planning units. Yellow units have more than 50\\% of their area already in a reserve."}
# load data
data(cs_pus)

## plot planning units
# convert SpatialPolygons to PolySet for quick plotting
cs_pus2 <- SpatialPolygons2PolySet(cs_pus)

# create vector of colours for planning units
# + light green: units not already inside reserve
# + yellow: units already inside reserve
cs_pus_cols <- rep('#c7e9c0', nrow(cs_pus@data))
cs_pus_cols[which(cs_pus$status==2)] <- 'yellow'

# set plotting window
par(mar=c(0.1, 0.1, 4.1, 0.1))

# plot polygons
PBSmapping::plotPolys(
	cs_pus2, col=cs_pus_cols, border='gray30', 
	xlab='', ylab='', axes=FALSE, 
	main='Case-study planning units',
	cex=1.8
)

# reset plotting window
par(mar=c(5.1, 4.1, 4.1, 2.1))
```

To map the distribution of environmental conditions across the species' range, 21 [bioclimatic layers](http://www.worldclim.org/bioclim) were obtained. These layers were cropped to Australia and subject to [detrended correspondence analysis](http://cc.oulu.fi/~jarioksa/softhelp/vegan/html/decorana.html) to produce two new variables. These layers are stored in the `cs_space` object.

```{r, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=7, fig.cap="Broad-scale environmental variation across Australia. The variable DC1 describes the transition from wet and cool to dry and hot conditions. The variable DC2 describes the transition from wet and hot to dry and cool conditions."}
# load data
data(cs_space)

# plot variables
plot(cs_space, main=c('DC1', 'DC2'), legend=FALSE, axes=FALSE)
```

#### Effectiveness of Australia's reserve network compared to optimal prioritisations
To simplify the process of formatting data and generating prioritisations, we can use the `rap` function. First, we will generate an amount-based prioritisation that aims to capture 10% of the rosella's range. We will use 50 demand points to map the geographic and environmental spaces. **Be warned, the examples hereafter can take 5-10 minutes to run.**

```{r, message=FALSE}
# make amount-based prioritisation
# and ignore existing protected areas by discarding values in the 
# status (third) column of the attribute table
cs_rs_amount <- rap(
	cs_pus[,-2], cs_spp, cs_space,
  amount.target=0.1, space.target=NA, n.demand.points=50L,
  include.geographic.space=TRUE, formulation='unreliable',
  kernel.method='hypervolume', quantile=0.7, solve=FALSE
)
```

```{r, eval=use.Gurobi}
# generate prioritisation
cs_rs_amount <- solve(cs_rs_amount, MIPGap=0.1)
```

```{r, eval=!use.Gurobi, include=FALSE}
cs_rs_amount <- solve(
	cs_rs_amount,
	b=cache$cs_rs_amount
)
```

```{r, fig.height=5.5, fig.width=5.5, out.width='3.5in', out.height='3.5in', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Multi-species prioritisation generated for four bird species using amount-based targets (20\\%). See Figure 12 captions for conventions."}
# show summary
summary(cs_rs_amount)

# plot prioritisation
plot(cs_rs_amount, 1)
```

We can also see how well the prioritisation secures the species' distributions in the geographic and environmental attribute spaces.

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=9, fig.cap="Distribution of amount-based prioritisation in the geographic attribute space. Points denote combinations of environmental conditions. Green and grey points represent planning unit selected for and not selected for prioritisation (respectively). Blue points denote demand points, and their size indicates their weighting."}
# plot prioritisation in geographic attribute space
p1 <- space.plot(cs_rs_amount, 1, 2, main='Blue-winged kookaburra')
p2 <- space.plot(cs_rs_amount, 2, 2, main='Brown-backed honeyeater')
p3 <- space.plot(cs_rs_amount, 3, 2, main='Brown falcon')
p4 <- space.plot(cs_rs_amount, 4, 2, main='Pale-headed rosella')
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol=2)
```

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=9, fig.cap="Distribution of amount-based prioritisation in the environmental attribute space. See Figure 28 caption for conventions."}
# plot prioritisation in environmental attribute space
p1 <- space.plot(cs_rs_amount, 1, 1, main='Blue-winged kookaburra')
p2 <- space.plot(cs_rs_amount, 2, 1, main='Brown-backed honeyeater')
p3 <- space.plot(cs_rs_amount, 3, 1, main='Brown falcon')
p4 <- space.plot(cs_rs_amount, 4, 1, main='Pale-headed rosella')
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol=2)
```

Next, let's generate a prioritisation using amount- and space-based targets. This prioritisation will secure 50% of the species distribution in geographic and environmental space.

```{r, message=FALSE, eval={use.Gurobi}}
# make amount- and space-based prioritisation
cs_rs_space <- update(cs_rs_amount, space.target=0.9)
```

```{r, eval={!use.Gurobi}, include=FALSE}
# make amount- and space-based prioritisation
cs_rs_space <- update(cs_rs_amount, space.target=0.9, solve=FALSE)
cs_rs_space <- solve(
	cs_rs_space,
	b=cache$cs_rs_space
)
```

```{r, fig.height=5.5, fig.width=5.5, out.width='3.5in', out.height='3.5in', fig.align='center'}
# show summary
summary(cs_rs_space)

# plot prioritisation
plot(cs_rs_space,1)
```

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=9, fig.cap="Distribution of the amount- and space-based prioritisation in the geographic attribute space. See Figure 28 caption for conventions."}
# plot prioritisation in geographic attribute space
p1 <- space.plot(cs_rs_space, 1, 2, main='Blue-winged kookaburra')
p2 <- space.plot(cs_rs_space, 2, 2, main='Brown-backed honeyeater')
p3 <- space.plot(cs_rs_space, 3, 2, main='Brown falcon')
p4 <- space.plot(cs_rs_space, 4, 2, main='Pale-headed rosella')
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol=2)
```

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=9, fig.cap="Distribution of the amount- and space-based prioritisation in the environmental attribute space. See Figure 28 caption for conventions."}
# plot prioritisation in environmental attribute space
p1 <- space.plot(cs_rs_space, 1, 1, main='Blue-winged kookaburra')
p2 <- space.plot(cs_rs_space, 2, 1, main='Brown-backed honeyeater')
p3 <- space.plot(cs_rs_space, 3, 1, main='Brown falcon')
p4 <- space.plot(cs_rs_space, 4, 1, main='Pale-headed rosella')
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol=2)
```

Let's compare these prioritisations with Queensland's existing protected areas system. To do this, we can create update the `cs_rs_space` with manually specified solutions to create a `RapSolved` object to represent the Queensland's reserve network.

```{r}
# generate vector with Australia's selections
aus_selections <- which(cs_pus$status>0)

# create new object with Australia's network
cs_rs_aus <- update(cs_rs_amount, b=aus_selections)
```

Now, let's plot the performance metrics for these prioritisations.

```{r, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=8, fig.cap="Prioritisations were generated using amount-based targets (20\\%), and with additional space-based targets (85\\%). These are compared to the Queensland reserve network. Data represent means and standard errors for the four species in each prioritisation."}
# define standard error function
se=function(x){sd(x,na.rm=TRUE)/sqrt(sum(!is.na(x)))}

# create a table to store the values for the 3 prioritisations
cs_results <- data.frame(
	name=rep(rep(c('Amount-based prioritisation', 
		'Amount+space-based prioritsation', 'Queensland reserve network'),
		each=4),3),
	variable=rep(c('Amount', 'Geographic space', 'Environmental space'), each=12),
	species=colnames(amount.held(cs_rs_amount)),
	value=c(
		amount.held(cs_rs_amount)[1,], amount.held(cs_rs_space)[1,],
			amount.held(cs_rs_aus)[1,],
		space.held(cs_rs_amount, space=2)[1,], space.held(cs_rs_space, space=2)[1,], 
			space.held(cs_rs_aus, space=2)[1,],
		space.held(cs_rs_amount, space=1)[1,], space.held(cs_rs_space, space=1)[1,],
			space.held(cs_rs_aus, space=1)[1,]
	)
) %>% group_by(
	name,
	variable
) %>% summarise(
	mean=mean(value),
	se=se(value)
)

# plot the performance metrics
ggplot(aes(x=variable, y=mean, fill=name), data=cs_results) +
	geom_bar(position=position_dodge(0.9), stat='identity') +
	geom_errorbar(
		aes(ymin=mean-se, ymax=mean+se), position=position_dodge(0.9),
		width=0.2
	) +
	xlab('Property of species') +
	ylab('Proportion held in\nselected planning units (%)') +
	scale_fill_discrete(
		name=''
	) +
	theme_classic() +
	theme(legend.position='bottom',legend.direction='horizontal')
```
We can see that a greater number of planning units is needed to satisfy the space-based targets. The prioritisation generated using just amount-based targets has `r sum(selections(cs_rs_amount)==1)` planning units, and the prioritisations using amount-based and space-based targets has `r sum(selections(cs_rs_space)==1)` targets.  These results suggest that prioritisations generated using only amount-based targets can obtain a moderately representative sample of the species' geographic distribution and climatic niche. 

## Implications and future directions
The \texttt{rapr} R package provides a unified approach to reserve selection. This R package provides decision makers with the tools to generate prioritisations that secure both biodiversity patterns and processes. Additionally, the package contains funcionality to accommodate uncertainty in the distribution of features, and also identify suitably connected reserves. Both the simulated and case-study species suggest that conservation planning exercises need to explicitly consider biodiversity processes during the reserve selection process to capture them.

One of the key advantages of the \texttt{rapr R} package is that it is general enough that any spatial variation could be considered an attribute space, regardless of whether this variation is intrinsic or extrinsic to the feature(s). For example, advances in genomic fields produced high resolution data on genetic information (eg. amplified fragment length polymorphisms, AFLPs; single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs). By using geostatistical analysis [eg. generalised dissimilarity modelling GDMs and gradient forests; @r370; @r452], this data has been used to generate maps describing the spatial distribution of genomic variation within a species [@r361; @r419]. These maps in turn could be used to construct a genomic attribute space, and in turn, could be used to generate prioritisations that secure a representative sample of genomic variation within a species. However, because the problem formulations used in this package are so general, the tools in this package could be misused, and generate poor quality prioritisations.

The degree to which a prioritisation truly secures a representative sample of a feature depends on the attribute spaces and distribution of demand points chosen by the decision maker. Ultimately, the space-based targets are set as a proportion based on the distribution of the demand-points. As a consequence, if the decision maker uses an inappropriate set of spatial variables to construct an attribute space, or an inappropriate set of demand points, then the optimal solution will not be an effective prioritisation in reality. We therefore stress that decision makers must carefully consider which biodiversity processes need to preserved in the prioritisation, and what spatial data can be used to map these processes. Note that maximising one process can be detrimental to another. For instance, to maximise the geographic spread of a prioritisation, reserves need to be further away from each other. Whereas, to maximise the connecitivity of a prioritisation, reserves ineed to be closer to each other. To assist in the selection of appropriate demand points, the \texttt{R} package provides several routines for generating demand points (see the `make.DemandPoints` function). These routines essentially use the distribution of a feature in the attribute space to define a polygon. Demand points are then generated as random points within the polygon. A kernel is then fit to the distribution of the feature in the space [using @r231; @r450], and the demand points are weighted based on the estimated density of the feature at the demand points'.

The \texttt{rapr R} package could be further extended to identify more effective prioritisations. First, the formulation of fragmentation used in this package may be too simplistic in some cases (eg. exercises involving multiple species with different dispersal capabilities), and more realistic measures of fragmentation (eg. those used in Zonation) could be used to identify more effective prioritisations. Second, the problem does not consider temporal dynamics. Here, conservation actions are assumed to be implemented simultaneously in all selected planning units and assumed to remain implemented for all time. As a consequence, this \texttt{rapr R} package is not useful for scenarios where actions are implemented during multiple discrete periods in time (eg. actions are made adue to annual funding cycles), or scenarios involving threatening processes that vary across space and time [reviewed in @r11]. Future research may look into incorporating such elements into this \texttt{R} package.

To maximise the long-term persistence of biodiversity--the stated goal of conservation--decision makers need to identify prioritisations that preserve existing patterns of biodiversity and the processes that support them. To achieve this, conservation planners need a decision support tool that can explicitly accommodate biodiversity patterns and processes. Here, we developed the \texttt{rapr R} package to fill this void. By exploring the functiontality of this package using several simulated species, we found that including space-based targets can radically change a prioritisation for the simplest of species.
